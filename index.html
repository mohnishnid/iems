              the lookout for ‘serious’ audio products is always tricky to
              choose. While true wireless earbuds undoubtedly add quality and
              value to the buyer in terms of convenience and ease of use, if you
              choose to trade them for better audio, you get excellent sound

        <h1>Frequency Spectrum Regions & Vocals / Instruments</h1>

        <div class="regdsc">
          <div>
            <div class="range1">
              <h4>
                SUB BASS <br />
                (20Hz - 80 Hz)
              </h4>
              <p>
                The first section of the frequency spectrum is the sub-bass.
                Everything below 80Hz is sub-bass, so generally, you need a
                subwoofer or a good pair of headphones (open-back headphones,
                for example) to hear this region. This region comprises
                instruments like the Kick Drum and the Bass Guitar. You should
                be able to hear Sub-Bass if you’re listening on monitors or
                headphones. But if you’re listening on a laptop or a phone,
                there’s no way you will hear that.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="range2">
              <h4>
                MID BASS <br />
                (80 Hz - 300 KHz)
              </h4>
              <p>
                After the Sub-Bass region, we get into the region known as the
                Bass or Mid-Bass. This region consists of everything between 80
                and 300 hertz. In this area, we’ve got instruments like bass
                guitar and the low end of a snare. Lots of the low-end vocals as
                well, because male vocals are going to have the fundamental
                below 200Hz in most cases.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="range3">
              <h4>
                LOWER MIDRANGE <br />
                (300 Hz - 1000 KHz)
              </h4>
              <p>
                Next, if you go from 300 Hz up to 1000 kHz, this is known as the
                Lower Midrange, and this is a crucial region for music because
                this is where you get a lot of buildup with guitars, vocals, and
                even the top-end of the bass guitar especially. Lower Midrange
                is an area guilty of adding mud to a mix and clarity in this
                region lifts a track exponentially.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="range4">
              <h4>
                UPPER MIDRANGE <br />
                (1 KHz - 6 KHz)
              </h4>
              <p>
                Human hearing focuses inherently on this frequency range. So
                it’s crucial to get this range right. This region consists of
                the main focus of the track (e.g. vocals) and synths. Be aware
                that this is also where you can start to get into harshness and
                aggressive tones.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="range5">
              <h4>
                TREBLE <br />
                (6 KHz - 10 KHz)
              </h4>
              <p>
                After the Upper Midrange, we’ve got the Treble region between
                6kHz and 8 kHz, and this is where things start to get harsh.
                This region is where we have brittleness from instruments like
                the Hi-Hats and Cymbals. This is also a crucial range for
                clarity and aggression, especially for female vocals.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="range6">
              <h4>
                AIR <br />
                (10 KHz - 20 KHz)
              </h4>
              <p>
                At the end of the frequency spectrum, we get to the Air region
                or the Top End. This region consists of everything above 10 kHz.
                This is where we have air and this is where we get a sense of
                shine and sparkle in our music.
